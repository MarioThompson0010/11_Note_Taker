List of technologies used: npm, Javascript, Nodejs, Heroku, Express, routes, full stack

## Description: My first FULL STACK program 

This program will record your notes.  The front-end was built already as boilerplate code, but I built a routed, back-end server that stored information in a file and returned it to the front-end.

If you need help taking notes, this program is for you.  You simply click on the pencil icon in the right hand side to open up (if it's not already open) the screen controls that will allow you to create a note.  Once you have at least one character in the title and the text sections, the save changes icon appears; it enables you to save changes.  

The data gets sent from the web browser all the way to the server.  The server stores the data in a text file (in json format).  

The user may also delete a note.  Simply click the garbage can icon next to each note.  This deletes the note not only from memory, but also from the database.  

The user may also display a note and its detail.  Simply click a row that's in a list of rows.  

## How to run the program:

1) Go to https://hidden-hollows-43738.herokuapp.com/
2) Click on the Get Started button.
3) Answer the questions.
4) Put your cursor where it says Note Title.  Enter a title and a note.
5) Click the save changes icon.
6) Click on a row that has your title on it.
7) Now delete it by clicking on the garbage can icon.

## How to test this app

Create a bunch of notes.  Delete them all.  See if you crash.
